# Connected-Component-Analysis-Image-Processing-
The complete code of connected component analysis which is an algorithm in image processig that is used to detect different objects from a binary image.
### I used the following approach:
Read binary image as you can see in files
Applied connected component analysis
And then count the equivilancy list
are print the result.
### Application of this code:
It can be used to  perform different operations on image  it like 
Counting the number of objects in an image.
Finding the biggest object in the image.
Finding the smallest object in the image.
Finding the closest objects in image.
Finding the farthest objects in image.
