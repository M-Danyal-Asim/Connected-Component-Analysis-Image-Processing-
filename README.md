# Connected-Component-Analysis-Image-Processing-
<p>The complete code of connected component analysis which is an algorithm in image processig that is used to detect different objects from a binary image.</p>

### I used the following approach:
<p> Read binary image as you can see in files with name "input_image.png".</p>
<p align="center">

</p>
<p>2 - Applied connected component analysis.</p>
<p>3 - And then count the equivilancy list.</p>
<p>4 - and print the result.</p>

### Application of this code:
<p>It can be used to  perform different operations on image  it like.</p> 
<p>Counting the number of objects in an image.</p>
<p>Finding the biggest object in the image.</p>
<p>Finding the smallest object in the image.</p>
<p>Finding the closest objects in image.</p>
<p>Finding the farthest objects in image.</p>
